        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Stressed? We get it.</p>
        <p>The college admissions process is not easy, and its not supposed to be. You’re taking the first steps toward the next four or five years of your life, a journey that begins with a single word.</p> 
        <p>While you can’t go back and change the last four years of your life, your essays are something personal to you, and with the added uncertainties of a global pandemic, being focused is becoming more important now than ever.</p>
        <p>You can’t choose your home or ever truly eliminate the distractions inherent to your environment, but you can clean up your online essay writing ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Happlicant offers a sleek and centralized solution to the distraction problem, offering a focused environment to brainstorm, write, and research.</p>
